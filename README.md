###Q/A

Q: What is IoXterm?

A: `IoXterm is an application that you write a command in to, and it does something. But, IoXterm is a coding language called Shale also, Shale is built in to IoXterm. To create a Shale script, scroll down to the Scripting section.`

###Shale basics
Well, you need a file to code shale in to, so you should create a file.
Let say ours is called `test`, to make this a Shale file, add `.ce` as the extension. 

######How to run Shale
Open IoXterm, and type the following command:
<br>
`run@/Users/johndoe/Desktop/test.ce`

###How to code in Shale
The first command you <b>always</b> learn in a coding language is the famous `print` command.
In Shale it is pretty basic.
Open your `test.ce` (or any `.ce` file) in a text editor.
Type:<br>
`print:Hello, World!`

Save it and <a href="https://github.com/Liamnardo/Xterm/blob/master/README.md#how-to-run-shale">run it.</a><br>
The output should be: `Hello, World!`. If it is not, send your command you just ran to me. I will try to fix the problem.<br><br>

All commands in Shale run in the IoXterm as sigle commands.
To learn more Shale code, go to the Libr.txt. :)
